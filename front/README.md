# Exercise
## Description
You are working in a project called superMarketApp. A developer who work with you, has just finished 
a new feature development that consists of a new "fruits section" in which you can check the list of 
fruits, add a new fruit and see some statistics regarding to fruit prices.

## TODO
You have to do a code review of the development that your colleage has done.
For that, you must check the code under /src/app.

You have to add all your remarks directly as comments in the code, starting every comment 
by "CodeReview" this way:
> // CodeReview YourRemarksHere

We are going to valuate your ability to find code smells, error designs and all the improvements
that you think must be done to keep the code clear, readable, maintainable, etc.

It is allowed to do very small changes in the code if you think that they are 
too obvious.
But don't forget that this is a code review, so you should just provide instructions
to your colleage about how to improve the code in comments.

Create a commit in master with your remarks.
Compress the whole project and send it back by email.
